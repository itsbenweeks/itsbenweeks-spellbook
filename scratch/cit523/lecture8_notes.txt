Measuring complexity
===

We want our code to return a correct response, but we also want it to do so with minimal **computational complexity**.

We can  think of complexity in a few different ways:

 * **Logatrithmic** complexity is the most efficient, and usually utilizes a factorial of some sort to eliminate possabilities. It is quite helpful.
 * **Linear** complexity will grow at a steady rate, and is generally quite an easy way to think.
 * **Exponential** complexity will grow in complexity quite quickly. It is generally avoided for this case.

It's important to note that combinations of these can also occur (although logarithmic * exponential is just liear complexity). Solutions that are linear logarithmic will become more complex at a slower rate than a solution of linear complexity, and exponential linear is also to be avoided.
